NECT courses are a series of self-study courses. This means that you need to take responsibility for your own learning. It also means you can take this course at a pace that suits you the best and also retake the course whenever you feel like it.

There will be chapters with exercises and quizzes for you and also interactive demos called screencasts, more about how you interact with those later.

###### TIPS & TRICKS:

* It is important that you go through the chapters from start to finish. Don't skip ahead - you will miss important information.

* Take your time with the screencasts, look at them and interact with the code several times.

* Go through the whole course - then revisit it again once you finished. Rome wasn't built in a day - and you can not learn how to code in a day. It takes time, patience, practice and passion - but the good news is anyone can become a programmer!
