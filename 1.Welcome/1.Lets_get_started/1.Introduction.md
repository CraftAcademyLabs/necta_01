**The web is a very large place, and if you are the typical internet user, you probably visit several websites every day, whether for business, entertainment or education. But have you ever wondered how these websites actually work? How are they built?**

In this course, you’ll get your first insight into the world of web development. 

Web development is a complex thing but the good news is that it’s not beyond your reach. 



##### WHAT TO EXPECT?

In this course, we will introduce you to the world of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

* **HTML** is the markup language used to change a text document into a web page. Everything you see in your browser is written in HTML. 
* **CSS** - Cascading Style Sheets, brings the look and feel to web pages adding fonts and colours to HTML. 
* And finally, **JavaScript** brings computing power to your browser and allows for a richer user experience. 


Together these three technologies form the backbone of the internet as we know it. 

This course is geared towards anyone who is interested in taking a sneak peek under the hood of all the digital services that we encounter and use throughout our everyday life.
