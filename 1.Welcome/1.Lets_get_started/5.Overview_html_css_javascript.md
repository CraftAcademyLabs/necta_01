If we look at a web page like we would at a house: 

1. HTML (content & structure) would be all the components that goes in to the frame of the house: 
    - Walls
    - Windows
    - Doors
    - Floors etc..

2. CSS (presentation/styling) would be all that make the house pretty: 
    - Colors of the walls    
    - Where you put the furniture inside the house etc.. 

3. And, finally, JavaScript (behaviour) will make your house functional: 
    - Adding an alarm system
    - Having electricity so you can turn on the lights
    - Making you stove work so that you can cook food



Here is yet another example:
