You will use a text editor at the end of this course. We suggest that you download it now and start playing around with it. A Text editor is were we write all our code.  
There are many editors out there we can use. [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is one, [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) is another, but our editor of choice for this course is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is brought to us by the good people of Microsoft and comes with over 3000 extension packages - all open sourced.

Download and install VSC by following the instructions on their [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Once that's done you can browse around for some packages you might find useful. Or you wait with that until you actually know what 'useful' is in the context of coding.
