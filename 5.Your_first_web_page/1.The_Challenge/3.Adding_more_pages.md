**So you want your site to have more than one page, right? Otherwise it wouldn't really be a Web Site, just a page.. So let's recap what we already learned about adding more pages.**


First you need to create a new HTML document. You do that by adding a file and call it, for example `about.html`. You can add whatever you want in there, as long as you have the structure of a HTML document in place.

After that we want to be able to go between pages. We do that by using a `<nav>` tag.

After you have opened a `<nav>` tag you add a list tag, preferable a `<ul>` tag, unordered list. And we add a `<li>` tag, list items, and to make the links functional we have add an `<a>` tag, anchor tag.

```html
<li> <a href="about.html"> About</a> </li>
```
