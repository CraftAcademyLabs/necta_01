So a slideshow is a nice feature to have on your website. It changes a set of images that you have added, making your site more dynamic.

Start by adding a folder called `image`, then you can drag and drop local images in to that folder. After that you add a `<section>` inside of the `<body>` in your HTML doc, were you can add your images with an `<img>` tag. Don't forget to add the `class="mySlides"` inside of the `<img>` tag. See example below.

Let's move over to the JavaScript file. To make your slideshow dynamic add the variable `myIndex` and set it to `0`.

Under that you call on the function `carousel` (another word for slideshow).

The function carousel needs to include two variables, in this case `i` and `slides`. The `slides` variable gets the HTML element by calling on `class="slide"` then it displays the images that you added before. Then you call on the variable `myIndex` again and add `setTimeout`. The `setTimeout` is given two attributes, `carousel` (which is the function) and `3000` (which is the time between changing slides). You can modify the time to suit you.

And, voil√†! You have a nice slideshow on your website.
