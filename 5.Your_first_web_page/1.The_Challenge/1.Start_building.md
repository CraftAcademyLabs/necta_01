So now it is finally time for you to start building your own web site and use the text editor Atom. You should go back and forth to the previous material we already covered in this course. Start with one HTML document `index.html` and keep on building from that.

##### Index page

Start by adding structure to your document:

Then you save it as `index.html`. With the end `.html` the document now knows what type of language you are writing in.

Now you can go ahead and add some content like a heading `<h1>`, some text `<p>`, a navbar `<nav>`.

_After you have added some code you can either right click in your document and go to Preview HTML:_

Or you can go to the local document on your desktop and double click that:
