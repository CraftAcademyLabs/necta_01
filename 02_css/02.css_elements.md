## CSS Elements - connected to scrimba_css.css and scrimba_css.html


Now we want our web site to pop a little bit more. Let's add some colours. 

Import this to scrimba_css.css

```
html, body {
    background: #F0F8FF;
    color: #008B8B;
}

h1, p {
    color: #9932CC;
}

#navbar a {
    color: #008B8B;
}

.item {
    background: #FFB6C1;
}

button {
    background: #008B8B;
    color: 	#FFFFE0;
}

```  

This won't take effect though without being linked with the HTML page. 

Let's add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="scrimba_css.css">` to our scrimba_css.html file and our home_css.html. 

Save and refresh the page. 

Now it is your turn to play around with the colours. 

ID vs Class 

Modifying our items on our portfolio page. It would be nice to make the corners rounded. 
So we'll add a border radius the item CSS element `border-radius: 25px;`
