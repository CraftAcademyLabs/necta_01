The `<body>` element defines the main content of the web document or rather the section of the document that will be directly visible to your users/visitors.

This means that whatever you place inside the `<body>` will be visible to whomever is viewing the page in their browser.

The content can for example be videos, images and text. There can only be one `<body>` element in a document.

Inside the `<body>` you can start by adding a main title with an `<h1>` tag. The `<h1>`, header 1 tag should be placed just below the opening `<body>` tag.

The next natural step would be to add some text to you page. We do that with the help of the `<p>`, paragraph tag.
