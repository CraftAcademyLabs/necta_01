###### DOCTYPE
The very first thing that you typically see in an HTML file is the DOCTYPE declaration. The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration tells the browser what type of document the file is and provides an instruction to the browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. I basically ensures that the browser displays the page properly.

After the DOCTYPE, the HTML really begins. This is indicated by the `<html>` element or tag, as we often will refer to it.

##### `<HTML>`
The `<html>` element is the container for all kind of information, both visible to the user in the browser as page content, and information that the user never sees, but is needed to properly display the page.
