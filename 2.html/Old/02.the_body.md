## The Body Part 1

The `<body>` tag defines the main content of the web document or rather the section of the document that will be directly visible to your users/visitors.

This means that whatever you place inside the `<body>` will be visible to whoever is viewing the page in their browser. The content can for example be videos, images and text.

Inside the `<body>` you can start by adding a main title with an `<h1>`tag. The `<h1>` tag should be placed just below the opening `<body>`tag.


When you added a main title for your document you can go ahead and include some text. We will put it in a pragraph tag `<p>`.
  ```
  <p> This is my first Web Page .</p>
  ```
This needs of course to be within the `<body>`tags.

To make the words Web Page in the text really stand out lets make it bold using a `<strong>`tag.
  ```
  <p> This is my first <strong> Web Page </strong>. </p>
  ```


So we have a Title and some Text, let us add an Image.
We will use an `<image>`tag and use a local image.  
```
<img src="images/craft_academy.png">  
```
The next attribute we'll look at is `alt`. Its value is supposed to be a textual description of the image, for use in situations where the image cannot be seen/displayed.
```
<img src="images/craft_academy.png"
     alt="CraftAcademy's logo">  
```
This will display the description when the image cannot be rendered.
