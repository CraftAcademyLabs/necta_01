## The Body Part 2 - adding some structure

So we have added some basic content. Now it is time to give our page some structure.
We will start by adding an `<header>` to our document. 

A `<header>`tag represents a group of introductory content. If it is a child of `<body>` it defines the global header of a webpage, but if it's a child of an `<article>` or `<section>`it defines a specific header for that section.

```
<header> 
</header>
```

We will also add a`<footer>` which will contain end content for the page.
```
<footer> 
</footer>
```

`<main>`tag is for content unique to this page. Use `<main>` only once per page, and put it directly inside `<body>`. Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.
    
```
<main>
</main>
```

`<article>` tag encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page for example an article or blog post. 
```
<main>

  <article>
  </article>

</main>
```

Lets add some content in this block. 

```
<main>

  <article>
    <h2> Heading </h2>
    
    <p> Some text </p>
    
    <h3> Subsection </h3>
      
    <p> Some more text </p>
  </article>

</main>
```
