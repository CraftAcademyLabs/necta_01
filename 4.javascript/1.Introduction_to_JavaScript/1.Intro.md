JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.

(Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

Examples of JavaScript:

Variable:

```javascript
let age = 32;
```

In JavaScript we'll typically want to store a function inside a variable:

```
let fn = function foo(a,b){
  return a + b;
}
```


###### A few notes 
* The following pages will give you a huge list of JavaScript variables to play with. Open up any browser (we suggest Chrome), click "Inspect" and click "Console". Then you can put in any JavaScript code. 
* JavaScript is very unforgiving. You have to be very careful about your commas, colons, parentheses, curly brackets, and everything else. Every line in JavaScript should end with a `;`.
