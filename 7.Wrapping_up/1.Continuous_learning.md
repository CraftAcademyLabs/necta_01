##### KEEP ON EDUCATING YOURSELF

The best ways to continue on your learning journey:

* Be curious. The internet is a big place and holds all the answers for you.
* Be wary though of the information you find. Check when the information was published and check the source. Web development languages change constantly and you need to find the right information. Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/) is a great platform where you can ask questions and get some answers.
* Get in the habit of coding - the experience you gained is easily forgotten. So set up a new routine for yourself and get in the habit of coding whenever you can.
* Be passionate and enjoy yourself. It's though to become a web developer if you don't enjoy coding.
* Enroll in a course or Bootcamp. You can teach yourself online - however, this approach requires major willpower, constraint and time. If you do not possess this - treat yourself to a course instead.
